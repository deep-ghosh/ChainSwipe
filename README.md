# 🧾 **ChainSwipe**

**Own Your Credit. Earn from Spending. Prove Your Identity.**

---

## 🔹 One-Liner

**ChainSwipe** is a decentralized finance platform that transforms on-chain activity into a verifiable credit score, enabling users to borrow, stake, and bridge assets in a secure, multi-chain ecosystem.

---

## 🔹 Description

ChainSwipe reimagines traditional credit scoring by leveraging blockchain activity to build a **Civil Score** — a transparent, on-chain credit reputation system.

Users can:
- Borrow stablecoins like **USDC** using crypto as collateral  
- Stake native tokens to earn rewards and boost credit tiers  
- Bridge assets across supported **EVM chains**  
- Verify identity securely through **KYC** to unlock premium features
