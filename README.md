ChainSwipe
Own Your Credit. Earn from Spending. Prove Your Identity.

One-liner:
ChainSwipe is a decentralized finance platform that transforms on-chain activity into a verifiable credit score, enabling access to loans, rewards, and cross-chain financial tools.

Description
ChainSwipe redefines credit in Web3 by introducing a decentralized civil score based on usersâ€™ on-chain behavior. It enables collateralized loans, staking, cross-chain bridging, and KYC verification â€” all within a privacy-preserving, user-controlled ecosystem.
