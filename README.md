ChainSwipe
Own Your Credit. Earn from Spending. Prove Your Identity.

One-Liner
ChainSwipe is a decentralized finance platform that transforms on-chain activity into a verifiable credit score, enabling users to borrow, stake, and bridge assets in a secure, multi-chain ecosystem.

Description
ChainSwipe reimagines traditional credit scoring by leveraging blockchain activity to build a Civil Score â€” a transparent, on-chain credit reputation.
Users can:

Borrow stablecoins like USDC using crypto as collateral

Stake native tokens to earn rewards and boost credit tiers

Bridge assets across supported EVM chains

Verify identity securely through KYC to unlock premium features
